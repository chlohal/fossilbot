# Profanity Matcher

This is a very small, and simple profanity matcher that scans for 900+ words and/or strings. This is not intended to be used as a robust profanity filter, but as a warning mechanism that a string of text might need to be approved or reviewed by a human before it's published.

Extended from [sloankev](https://www.npmjs.com/~sloankev)'s [profanity-scanner](https://www.npmjs.com/package/profanity-scanner). This version returns an array of matched words, or an empty array if none were found. I also combined the existing word list with the [google banned word list](https://gist.github.com/jamiew/1112488).

### Example Usage

```js
var pf = new Profanity_Scanner()
pf.scan('hello there!') // returns []
pf.scan('stfu.') // returns ['stfu']

pf.add_word('noobie') // returns true if added
pf.remove_word('noobie') // returns true if removed
```
